 RateLimiter (API)

x -Print more detailed information for GenBankMaster
x    -Eg.: 4255 records processed across 81 banks
x    -Eg.: 81 banks processed
x -Skip routine (Already downloaded Instn level and not doc level) should include counts of Skipped_df
x  -Create GenCallMaster method that just creates and loads df instead of creating file
  -GenBankMaster needs updated to use ftypes and not hardcoded XBRL
  -ExhibitCalcs file


#BUGS
x -Update folder paths in ETL & ExEngine
  -Time printed on RateLimiter and when to resume.  Maybe not accounting for DST?

##-------------------------------------
##OVERALL_PROCESS
Main:
 -Build Bank List
 -Download Call Reports
 -Save Call Reports into Structure
 -Extract and Parse XBRL
 -Build MasterCall Report


Before DownloadCallReports:
x -Check if skipped file exists
x -Read file contents (dict?)
x -Exclude skipped dates from loop to avoid api calls for dates that match Skipped_df


Check if Skipped file exists
x -Read Skipped file
x -Write Skipped file (create skipped file)
